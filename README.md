# CVE-2021-39623

Forcedentry state of the art exploit (as I read) used by NSO made it big. Libstagefright (Media Framework on Android) with OOB write on the heap (with Scudo) which can possibly own your Mobile by playing an audio file, didn't.

Media Framework is sandboxed as I know. So you can read/write media, make lateral movements on the mobile.

Working on LineageOS 18.1 (Android 11)

Somehow player is not using SimpleDecodingSource

Used stagefright utlity

Maybe on AOSP/Android 11 it is different. Not sure.

Here is the crash/stractrace:

Will upload the reproducer later on.
